From “The New York Times,” I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”
[UPBEAT MUSIC]
Today, the fallout from the extraordinary televised Oval Office shouting match between Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. My colleague, Chief White House Correspondent Peter Baker, walks us through the clash and its consequences.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
It’s Monday, March 3.
Peter, thank you for making time for us on a Sunday afternoon, no less. We appreciate it.
Peter Baker
Thanks for having me.
Michael Barbaro
I’m curious, Peter, where in the pantheon of moments that you have witnessed at the White House over the past 30 years, to date you, does what happened in the Oval Office on Friday fit would you say?
Peter Baker
Michael, I’ve been covering these meetings at White Houses since 1996, and I’ve never seen anything like this. Never you. Had the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, show up for a meeting with the president of United States, Donald Trump, in the middle of a war with so much at stake.
And so everybody was looking to this meeting to see how it would come together. I mean, it was extraordinary. It was excruciating. It was a brutal dressing down of a foreign leader in the Oval Office. Presidents just don’t do that. They get frustrated at times. Sometimes there are appointed moments, but nothing like this verbal assault that we’ve seen even on an adversary, much less on an ally. And I think in history, we’re going to look back on this as a unique, singular moment.
Michael Barbaro
Right. And not just for the spectacle of it, but for its actual consequential.
Peter Baker
Absolutely. Right. This is a rupture of a relationship now between the United States and Ukraine, 11 years after Russia first invaded and three years after it’s full-fledged invasion in 2022. And America has been Ukraine’s best friend, biggest partner, most important patron. And if this rupture, this blowup, this meltdown in the Oval Office means that the relationship now is on the rocks, it has great consequence for Ukraine, especially. It has great consequence for Russian aggression in the world, for Europe, and for the United States, I would say.
Michael Barbaro
Right. And for all those reasons, I suspect, history will keep turning over this encounter for a very long time, as will we in this conversation in a few moments. But I think it’s worth setting up a bit what led to this blowup and talk through the kind of dynamics into which both men entered the Oval Office on Friday.
Peter Baker
Right. Well, first of all, it’s important to know the history. President Trump has never liked Ukraine in particular. He was convinced, way back in his first term, that Ukraine had been opposed to his election in 2016. This is a Russian talking point. This is a Russian intelligence fable but one that Trump bought into. And of course, Zelenskyy was the other guy on the phone when he had the, quote, “perfect” phone call — not so perfect — that led to his impeachment, in which he tried to bully Zelenskyy into launching a fake investigation of Joe Biden.
Michael Barbaro
Two men have never had such awkward history, perhaps, as world leaders.
Peter Baker
Very awkward history. And during the last four years, when Trump was out of office, he was never supportive of Ukraine in its war against Russia. He praised Vladimir Putin for being a genius, for sending troops to pressure Ukraine into making concessions. And he opposed aid to Ukraine, basically blocked it, by Republicans in the House, forced them to block it for about six months. And sitting next to him was JD Vance, who was famously quoted saying, “I don’t care what happens in Ukraine.” So these are not supporters of Ukraine going into this meeting.
And then over the last two weeks, you see the relationship really changed dramatically. Instead of Joe Biden sending arms and standing with Ukraine, saying, we will never, never, never not be with you, you have Donald Trump coming in and calling Zelenskyy a dictator, saying it was Ukraine, falsely, that started the war, adopting Russian talking points about whether Zelenskyy should have to have elections.
Never mind that Vladimir Putin is the dictator, that he started the war and that he has fake elections at home. He was basically 180 degrees changing American policy towards Russia and Ukraine, making clear that in this new Cold War that we’ve been talking about now for so long, America was essentially switching sides.
And for Zelenskyy, this is existential for him. And he faced this pressure from Trump to sign a rare minerals deal, handing over a lot of Ukraine’s natural resources to the United States without any assurance that the United States is going to give them anything back. Trump said, you owe us, basically, for all the aid that Biden gave you over the last three years. So Zelenskyy, unhappily, grudgingly, comes to Washington as almost a supplicant to sign this agreement, hoping that that will keep Trump on Ukraine’s side in any future peace talks.
Michael Barbaro
Right. So Zelenskyy, as you’ve clearly just laid out here, has no affection for Trump but will agree to come to Washington to sign this minerals deal, mostly to protect whatever existing frayed, attenuated relationship the US still has with Ukraine as a supporter of its defense.
Peter Baker
Yes, that’s right, because he hopes that it will keep the United States on Ukraine’s side. Give it something at stake in the war, in this case, economic stakes. And he knows how much that matters to Trump. So Zelenskyy shows up at the White House on Friday morning, and Trump comes out at the door to greet him, as he does with foreign leaders. And they have a polite handshake but not a lot of warmth, I would say. And Trump makes a comment as Zelenskyy arrives that later, I think, becomes kind of telling. He says, I see you came dressed up for the occasion.
Zelenskyy, of course, is wearing his tactical dark sweater, one of the versions of the combat-type clothing he’s been wearing for the last three years in solidarity with Ukrainian soldiers. And they go into the Oval Office. They take their seats. There’s a number of top officials there. JD Vance is there. Secretary Rubio is there. And the meeting gets off to a relatively fine start.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
Well, thank you very much. It’s an honor to have President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. And we’ve been working very hard, very close. So we’ve actually known each other for a long time. We’ve been dealing with each other for a long time and very well.
Peter Baker
But Zelenskyy is trying to make sure Trump understands that Ukraine is the victim, not the villain in this war.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
I wanted to share with you some images how it’s — you have just — yes, can I now?
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
Yeah, please. Please.
Peter Baker
And he shows him pictures of Ukrainian men and women who have been released from Russian prisons, and how emaciated they are, how terribly abused they had been in Russian captivity. He tries to get Trump to see that the Russians are the bad guys here.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
I mean, it’s looking tragic.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
Yeah, that’s tough stuff.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
Yeah, I wanted very much to give you —
Peter Baker
And the first 20 minutes, 25 minutes are perfectly normal, perfectly fine, but you begin to hear a little bit of an edge. You begin to hear a little bit of the tension that’s there.
Archived Recording 1
Does that mean you’ll provide security guarantees, Mr. President?
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
I don’t want to talk about security yet because I want to get the deal done. You fall into the same trap like everybody else a million times. You say it over and over. I want to get the deal done. Security is so easy. That’s about 2 percent of the problem. I’m not worried about security. I’m worried about getting the deal done.
Peter Baker
And they just don’t see the war in the same way.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
Before my presidency from the 2014, Putin broken 25 times. 25 times, he broken his own signature. 25 times, he broken ceasefire. It was —
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
But he never broke to me. He never broke to me.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
No, no, you were the president. You were the president.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
He never broke to me.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
In 2016, you been the president Mr. President. You’ve been the president, but he —
Peter Baker
Zelenskyy does not want Trump to negotiate a ceasefire with Russia with no conditions, and Ukraine gets nothing out of it. He doesn’t think Putin can be trusted.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
That’s why we will never accept just ceasefire. It will not work without security guarantees.
Peter Baker
He does not think that a ceasefire would hold, so he says, I need security guarantees. And that’s what he’s there to ask the United States for. And Trump does not want to have anything to do with it.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
I don’t think you’re going to need much security. I think once this deal gets done, it’s over. Russia is not going to want to go back, and nobody’s going to want to go back. When this deal ends, I really believe this deal is going to be over.
Peter Baker
But then, in the midst of this back and forth, suddenly, you hear a new voice.
Archived Recording (Jd Vance)
I want to respond to this. So look —
Peter Baker
It’s the vice president, JD Vance, who hasn’t really been talking in the meeting and pipes up, and he says, I want to interject here. And he offers a pointed defense of Trump’s approach to the conflict. Trump is the one, he says, who’s going to bring peace. He’s going to be engaging in diplomacy.
Archived Recording (Jd Vance)
That’s what President Trump is doing.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
Can I ask you?
Archived Recording (Jd Vance)
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
OK. So —
Peter Baker
And Zelenskyy, who’s been listening to all this, really feels like he has to respond here.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
During 2014 till 2022, what the situation the same. That people have been dying on the contact line. Nobody stopped him.
Peter Baker
And Zelenskyy basically proceeds to pick apart this idea that diplomacy is necessarily going to work. He points out there’s a long history here. The war didn’t just start three years ago. It started in 2014, when Putin first sent forces into Ukraine, seized Crimea, began seizing parts of Eastern Ukraine. And he points out that this war has been going on ever since, including during Trump’s presidency.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
But after that, he broken the ceasefire. He killed our people, and he didn’t exchange prisoners. We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn’t do it.
Peter Baker
And that seems to get under Trump and Vance’s skin.
Michael Barbaro
Right. It feels worth noting that, in this moment, Zelenskyy decides to call the vice president, JD, not Vice President Vance.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?
Michael Barbaro
Perhaps, history will not note this as an important moment, I noted it.
Peter Baker
Yeah, absolutely. And look, on one level, you can say he’s trying to be friendly with him. Sometimes foreign leaders do refer to each other by their first names, but Vance takes offense and then jumps back in
Archived Recording (Jd Vance)
Mr. President — Mr. President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media.
Peter Baker
And this is when things go from bad to very bad.
Archived Recording (Jd Vance)
You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.
Peter Baker
You start hearing Vance say, you should be grateful to us, and really putting Zelenskyy on the defensive there. And Zelenskyy, of course, has thanked America for three years, quite prolifically. But what’s actually, I think, striking about that demand by Vance — you should be thanking us — is he is demanding that somebody thank two leaders who haven’t supported Ukraine. Trump and Vance don’t support Ukraine, and yet, he is saying, you have to thank us. And as Vance and Zelenskyy really kind of going at it —
Archived Recording (Jd Vance)
Do you disagree that you’ve had problems bringing people into your military?
Peter Baker
Vance is pushing Zelenskyy on problems that the Ukrainian military is having with manpower and so forth. And Zelenskyy says, yeah, of course, we have problems. You’ll have problems too, though.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
Even you. But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now, but you will feel it in the future.
Michael Barbaro
Yeah, just translate what he’s saying there because it feels like a really important point Zelenskyy is trying to make.
Peter Baker
His point is that Russia poses a threat to the United States, not just Ukraine. A lot of times Trump talks about this, he says, this is really a problem for Europe. It’s not for us. In fact, Trump has said we have this big ocean between us. So what do we care what happens in Ukraine? And Zelenskyy is pushing back on that idea. He says, listen, yes, you have this nice ocean and you don’t feel it now, a lot of distance between you and Russia. That doesn’t mean that Russia isn’t also a threat to the United States. It doesn’t mean that the United States doesn’t have a stake in this, has an interest in who wins this war and whether Russia comes out of it feeling rewarded for its aggression.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
I’m not telling —
Peter Baker
This is the moment that Trump now jumps in.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good.
Peter Baker
And he begins to really kind of berate Zelenskyy in this very aggressive way.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
— beginning of the war.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
I’m not playing cards.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
Right now, you don’t — you’re playing cards.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
Mr. President, I’m very serious.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
You’re playing cards.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
I’m the president in war.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III. You’re gambling with World War III.
Michael Barbaro
In effect, what Trump is saying is, Zelenskyy, all you need to understand is that you have no power right now. We have all the power. Get on board or you’re in real trouble.
Peter Baker
Yeah, exactly.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
People are dying. You’re running low on soldiers.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
I know. Don’t —
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
Listen.
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
Don’t — please —
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
You’re running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing —
Archived Recording (Volodymyr Zelenskyy)
Mr. President —
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
Then you tell us, I don’t want a ceasefire. I don’t want a ceasefire.
Peter Baker
What he’s saying is, you have to accept whatever deal I make with Putin. You don’t have any power. You’re not able to influence things. And that’s a really extraordinary thing to say to the leader of a country at war. He’s saying, you don’t get to choose here. I’m the one who’s going to choose here.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
Because let me tell you, you don’t have the cards. With us, you have the cards. But without us, don’t have any cards.
Archived Recording 1
One more question —
Peter Baker
What an extraordinary moment, right?
Michael Barbaro
Right.
Peter Baker
These two leaders really going at it over who and what happens in this conflict in the heart of Europe.
Michael Barbaro
We should say, at this moment, all three of these leaders, seasoned leaders, could have chosen to deescalate what’s becoming an incredibly acrimonious, almost shouting match, but they don’t. They all seem quite loaded for bear.
Peter Baker
They do. This is where clearly a lot of weeks, if not months, of tension have come to the surface. And they’re just exploding in this meeting, and they’re saying what they have been thinking or feeling for quite a while. And it just escalates rather than deescalate. And you finally get to the point where Trump is relitigating the whole Russia investigation.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt, where they used him and Russia — Russia, Russia, Russia. You ever hear of that deal? That was a phony — that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam, Hillary Clinton.
Peter Baker
And he says, Vladimir Putin and I went through this whole Russia hoax.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
And he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff. He had nothing to do with it. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bathroom. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bedroom. It was disgusting.
Peter Baker
What an amazing thing to say, right? The person he clearly feels a bond with is Putin, not with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who runs a democratic country that has been allied with the United States and is under fire.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
The problem is, I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy.
Peter Baker
Finally, Trump lays down his cards, and he says —
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
But you’re either going to make a deal, or we’re out. And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s going to be pretty, but you’ll fight it out.
Peter Baker
Basically, either you’re with us, either you go along with what I’m going to do or we’re out.
Michael Barbaro
We’ll abandon you.
Peter Baker
We’ll abandon you. It’s a very stark threat.
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
All right. I think we’ve seen enough. What do you think? Huh?
Archived Recording 2
What’s this negotiation —
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
Archived Recording (Donald Trump)
This is going to be great television, I will say that.
All right. We’ll see what we can do —
Peter Baker
And then the reporters are escorted out of the room.
Michael Barbaro
Peter, once the shock wore off, for me at least — and as I told you, I’m watching this as well — I had this sense — and I wonder if you did as well — that people in the two delegations, the Zelenskyy camp and the Trump camp, they’re going to find a way to try to smooth this over after the cameras leave the room, because, of course, they are there to sign a deal.
Peter Baker
Exactly. This deal is supposed to be signed. They’re supposed to use this deal to put the relationship on a new foundation going forward. And now, with the cameras out of the room, are they going to make apologies or at least smooth it over? And will they still have the lunch? Will they still sign the deal that was the whole point of him coming in the first place? Will they have the news conference that’s been set up in the East Room waiting for us any minute now? We don’t know.
But then suddenly, we get the answer. Zelenskyy’s car has just pulled up to the door of the West Wing, and he’s leaving.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Michael Barbaro
We’ll be right back.
Peter pick the story up where you just left it off. What ends up happening behind the scenes, based on your reporting, that ultimately ends with this day becoming totally unsalvageable?
Peter Baker
Well, what we ended up learning later is the two teams, the US team and the Ukrainian team, head into separate rooms in the West Wing to collect themselves after this bruising battle in the Oval Office. And Zelenskyy still wants to salvage this thing. He still wants to sign the deal. He still wants to see if he can’t smooth it over, but the US side, Trump and his team, are meeting in another part of the White House, and they are furious. And the answer to them is no. It’s over. Tell them to leave.
Michael Barbaro
Wow.
Peter Baker
And two US officials then go to the room where Zelenskyy and his team are, and explain to him, you’re out of here.
Michael Barbaro
Basically, they’re kicking Zelenskyy out of the White House.
Peter Baker
Exactly. Right. And so the reporters were all rushing out to the driveway, and there’s this Black Chevy SUV, the suburban, at the door of the West Wing, and out comes Volodymyr Zelenskyy, looking very grim faced as he climbs in. And then the suburban pulls out of the White House driveway and off the White House grounds. And you realize just how much has changed in those few minutes.
Michael Barbaro
Wow.
Peter Baker
So lunch is off. The press conference is off. Trump’s aides are busy eating the lunch that had actually been prepared for Zelenskyy, this roasted chicken and creme brulée. And Trump issues a statement on his social media platform. And it says, “I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace if America is involved. He disrespected the United States of America and its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace.”
Michael Barbaro
Peter, the reactions to this encounter are all over the place, as you might expect. You’ve got Republicans, some of them now saying it’s time for Zelenskyy to resign. And they are repeating the charge from Trump and Vance, that Zelenskyy wasn’t sufficiently respectful, and that Ukraine should send the United States a leader who can show the president of the United States more respect.
Then you’ve got congressional Democrats who are aghast that the president would berate the leader of a country that is an American ally and furious that we seem to be giving a boost to Russia by humiliating the leader of Ukraine. And so I’m curious what you’re making of those two drastically different responses to this same encounter.
Archived Recording 3
Senator Graham —
Peter Baker
Yeah, I was there on the White House driveway when Senator Lindsey Graham came out.
Archived Recording (Lindsey Graham)
What did I think? Complete, utter disaster.
Peter Baker
Essentially sent out by the White House to say, not only that it was Zelenskyy’s fault —
Archived Recording (Lindsey Graham)
I talked to Zelenskyy this morning. Don’t take the bait. President Trump was in a very good mood last night. Somebody asked me, am I embarrassed about Trump? I have never been more proud of the president.
Peter Baker
— and that he was proud of Trump for standing up for America, but that if Zelenskyy wouldn’t change that, he should even resign.
Archived Recording (Lindsey Graham)
What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful, and I don’t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again. I think —
Peter Baker
And what a remarkable 180 degrees for the Graham wing of the Republican Party, what used to be the Reagan wing of the Republican Party. Graham was one of the most hawkish, pro-Ukraine, anti-Russia voices on the scene, and now he has fallen in line behind Trump. But to Democrats, the only person who had been disrespected in that meeting was Zelenskyy.
Archived Recording 4
So all Zelenskyy asked yesterday was, how do you know that diplomacy will work? And because he had the audacity to ask that simple question, he was ushered out of the White House. And apparently, the United States is going to do Putin’s bidding and hand him —
Peter Baker
And the Democrats are the ones who are left to defend Ukraine and call for a more skeptical view of Russia and to cast Russia as the enemy.
Archived Recording 5
Zelenskyy is leading a country, trying to defend democracy against an authoritarian dictator, Putin, who invaded his country. And our job is to defend the 250-year tradition that we have of being the Democratic leader of the world, not turn our backs on a struggling country that is trying to do the right thing.
Michael Barbaro
Right. So that’s the domestic political response, Peter. But the responses that most intrigued me were from people who said, basically, wasn’t this a moment of unvarnished truth telling from President Trump? Ukraine does not have a good hand. It is deeply reliant on American military aid. It’s struggling to recruit soldiers. It cannot win a war of attrition against Russia, and it’s not really a priority for the Trump administration. So in a way, Trump was being very clear and very direct about all of that in this confrontation.
Peter Baker
Yeah, I mean, look, it is certainly the case that a lot of people believe the United States needs to focus its priorities either at home or perhaps against China, because that’s the bigger threat, and therefore we have to recalibrate our relationship with Europe, our commitments in Europe, our hostility toward Russia.
And the strategic thought that you hear from some people behind what happened on Friday is it’s time for us to cut bait and be friendlier with Russia because we need them against China. I don’t know how much that’s part of Trump’s own thinking, but certainly, some people around him give voice to that analysis.
Even so, of course, to see the very personal and visceral way that Trump was willing to cut loose an ally in furtherance of this strategy was pretty striking. Even if that’s what you wanted to do, doing it in this way, I think, was pretty shocking for a lot of people.
Michael Barbaro
Right. Which is a slightly different question, and one that is important, which is, was this done poorly and politely, shockingly so to some? But I think it feels like Trump’s goal here is to focus, like you just said, on Russia and China, and that, in the end, Ukraine stands in the way of that. Trump wants to be sitting down across from Putin or Xi Jinping. He does not want to have to be worrying about a war in Ukraine.
Peter Baker
No question that Trump respects strength and power. And he sees the world as a place where big men and big powers like the United States and Putin’s Russia divide up their spheres of influence, very much like a 19th century or mid-20th century view of things, while the democracies will simply have to eat it if they have to. In other words, what matters more is who is powerful, not who has the same kind of governmental system.
And that leaves the question, then, does Ukraine become, in effect, roadkill on the way to this realpolitik goal? And what happens to the US relationship with other democracies in Asia and Europe? And do we embolden authoritarian governments like Putin by rewarding them for their aggression?
Michael Barbaro
Well, a related question to this, Peter, is, is Europe going to pick up the slack? If the US, if Trump is going to walk away from this to focus on Russia and China, and, to use your words, potentially leave Ukraine as roadkill in the pursuit of that goal, is Europe going to step in and protect Ukraine?
And it was striking how much in the hours after Zelenskyy was kicked out of the White House, European leaders lionized him and posed the question of what their role needed to be if the US walks away? I mean, the prime minister of France wrote, “By refusing to bend in Washington, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was the honor of Europe.”
But then she goes on to write, “Now it is upon us Europeans to decide what we want to be and whether we want to be.” And I took that to mean her saying, Europe, are we going to step up and solve the problems for Ukraine that the US has until now but seems to be walking away from?
Peter Baker
Yeah, absolutely. So as soon as Zelenskyy leaves Washington, he heads to London, where he meets with European leaders, including Keir Starmer, the British prime minister. And this was already planned before the blowup in the Oval Office, but it’s such a remarkable amount of timing because he is greeted with open arms. The Europeans have rallied to his side. And one after the other, across the continent, they said, we stand with Ukraine. We stand with Zelenskyy. They say the things that you just quoted the French prime minister is saying.
And Starmer promises more funding, a couple more billion dollars worth of weapons for advanced air defense missiles, and talks about a peacekeeping force that the Europeans can put together even without the Americans. Once there is a peace deal, if there’s a peace deal, to try to enforce it. But it’s a test. It’s a real test because time and time again, Europeans have said, yeah, we’re going to step up and take more of the burden from the United States without actually following through.
And they have risen to the occasion with Ukraine over these last three years. They’ve actually donated more money for Ukraine’s defense than the United States has. You may have heard Trump say the opposite. He’s wrong about that. But it’s still a question whether they can do everything that Ukraine would need and would lose without American support. And for Europe, it really is a moment of truth.
Michael Barbaro
Right. And it seems worth noting that UK’s prime minister, even as he announced more money for Ukraine, said, we’ve got to be honest, we still need a backstop from the US. There’s nothing approaching a true guarantee of Ukraine’s safety unless the US is involved.
Peter Baker
That’s right. I mean, they don’t expect US to put troops on the ground. What they would like would be air support or logistical support or intel support, and mainly just political and geopolitical support. The idea that the United States is behind them on this, and that Russia ought not to try anything because it would not just be aggravating Europe but aggravating the United States and taking a real chance there. And it’s not clear that Trump wants to do that. He said, I don’t really care too much about what the security situation is after I make peace. He trusts Vladimir Putin to keep the deal. He doesn’t believe that there really needs to be any security guarantee because he thinks Putin can be trusted. Well, nobody in Ukraine thinks that. And very few people in Europe think that.
Michael Barbaro
Right. Peter, my final question for you is about Zelenskyy and what, based on your reporting, you think he is going to do now. He’s been issued this offer via President Trump to return to the White House but only as a man of peace.
And from everything you’re saying here, what that really means is that the president wants him to return as a person willing to capitulate and recognize that the US doesn’t really care as much as it once did about protecting Ukraine, and that he has to live and die by Trump’s hope that Putin would keep a deal that Trump makes. And that means giving up a lot.
And so I’m curious, do you think Zelenskyy will return to the White House on the terms that Trump wants or does he not return? And does he instead focus on Europe as a replacement and savior for Ukraine, as potentially insufficient as that might be?
Peter Baker
Yeah. I think that’s really one of the essential questions out of all of this. Look, in the immediate aftermath of this meltdown in the Oval Office, he tried to smooth it over, first with social media posts and later with an interview on Fox News, and in other comments saying, look, thank you, America, Thank you to the president.
And it was him, I think, trying to smooth it over in his own way, but he is a man of pride, too. He’s a man struggling to save his country from an aggressor. And there’s only so far he was willing to go. He said on Fox News he didn’t think he had anything to apologize for. He regretted it. He was sorry it happened, but he didn’t think he had done anything wrong.
And you’re right. Trump — if they put this back together, and it’s possible that they do, Trump will want him to come back in a supplicant form. And Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a lot of things, but he doesn’t really have the flattery gene that some of these other foreign leaders use to suck up to Trump. It’s just not his nature. And we’ll see whether or not he can do that, whether he should do that, whether that would be enough, even if he did. This is the new order right now, and the new order is, if you are not deferential to Trump, he will punish you.
So for Zelenskyy, the choice here basically is, how far is he willing to defer? How far is he willing to flatter? How far is he willing to subordinate himself on some level to Trump. And if he did do that, would it even work?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Would it even get him what he really thinks he needs?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Michael Barbaro
Well, Peter, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
Peter Baker

On Sunday night, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the Trump administration’s new policies towards countries like Ukraine, encapsulated by the Oval Office confrontation between Trump and Zelenskyy, had brought the United States much closer to Russia’s own approach. The spokesman said, quote, “The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations.” “This,” he added, “largely aligns with our vision.”

Here’s what else you need to know today. On Sunday, Israel disrupted its existing and agreed upon framework for ending its war with Hamas by saying it would immediately end the flow of all goods and humanitarian assistance into Gaza. The decision is an attempt by Israel to temporarily extend its ceasefire deal with Hamas without advancing to the next more delicate stage of negotiations. That stage would have required Israel to withdraw troops from Gaza and to commit to a permanent ceasefire in return for the release of the remaining Israeli hostages inside Gaza.
Hamas immediately denounced Israel’s decision, but it was clear that the Trump administration supports Israel’s new plan. And over the weekend, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked emergency powers to bypass Congress and send $4 billion in weapons to Israel.
